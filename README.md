# Javascript: Password Generator

## User Story
As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given I need a new secure password, when I click the button to generate a password then I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
When prompted for password criteria, then I select which criteria to include in the password.
When prompted for the length of the password, then I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
When asked for chractaer types to include in the password, then I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. 
When I answer each prompt, then my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected. 
When all prompts are answered, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
When the password is generated, then the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
